# CS303-1
First keep all the files in the same directory including the given input file "i.txt".
I have used total 5 functions. The function declarations are in the f.h and function definitions are in the f.cpp
Run the main.cpp file otherwise it would show an error.
The functions require user input.
If proper input is given all the functions run successfully. Here’s a screenshot

For the modifyValuewithexcpt function (a function to modify the value of a given index and return both the new and previous value) and the addNumwithexcpt function (a function to add a new integer at the end of the array) if any error occurs for example, if the user input isn’t within the range it would throw an error and show an error statement. There’s try catch blocks to handle the exceptions.
